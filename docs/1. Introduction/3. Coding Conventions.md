# Flamingo Commerce Coding Conventions

### Summary:
* [Flamingo Coding Conventions](https://docs.flamingo.me/2.%20Flamingo%20Core/1.%20Flamingo%20Basics/8.%20Coding%20Conventions.html) are applied
* We use Domain Driven Design and Ports and Adapters. Looking in the code should help understanding the e-commerce domain and should be semantic.
  
## Domain Driven Design
### Strategical
 
* each module represents a useful independent "sub" domain in the overall e-commerce area.
* Dependencies between modules should be useful, unidirectional and as less as possible.

### Tactical
 
* We stick to the [Flamingo Module structure](https://docs.flamingo.me/2.%20Flamingo%20Core/1.%20Flamingo%20Basics/3.%20Flamingo%20Module%20Structure.html) and use [Ports and Adapters](https://docs.flamingo.me/2.%20Flamingo%20Core/1.%20Flamingo%20Basics/4.%20Ports%20and%20Adapters.html)
* Domain Layer should be technology free and should have potent model in the boundary of the module.
    * Normally should not need to know about Session and Framework specific stuff
* Application Layer:
    * should contain thin and useful "Services" or "Handlers" that provide a use case oriented access to the logic of the domain layer.
    * Is allowed to access Session and Framework modules

## Configuration
Each module should document its supported configuration using cue.

## Runable (akka FakeAdapters)
Each module should be runable by default:
That means that the modules need to provide so called FakeAdapters for the required secondary ports. 
The Adapters Binding should be activated by a Featureflag (Configuration).

## Usage of Interfaces

Using interfaces in Go allows us to describe behaviour, without specifying an implementation.
This proves very helpful when splitting definitions of a service, such as a domain service, and the actual implementation, which can be specific to a certain technology/module.
Additionally interfaces allow us to generate so-called "mocks", which can be used in unit tests, to assert and mock a certain interaction without actually implementing/using the original functionality.

In Flamingo Commerce we agreed in the following:

### Usage of interfaces For Secondary Ports
Especially in the domain layer we use interfaces as secondary ports. 
This is essentially the part where different Adapters can implement the technical details independent from the domain logic.

In order 

### For improved testability

Defining interfaces other then for "secondary ports" makes sense to improve testability.
This might be especially useful for application services (living in the application/ folder).

There are two possible solutions to this problem:

1. one is that the application provider provides an additional interface as well as a default implementation
2. the other is that the consumer of a service specifies it's own interface.

#### Approach 1. (define interface in the providing package)

An module should provide an interface for its main application services if useful for testing:

* The interface has the sematic name
* The Implementation adds "Impl" to this name and is binded to the interface.

Example:

```go
// auth/application/service.go
package application

type (
    MyService interface {
      DoSomething()  
    }

    MyServiceImpl struct {
    
    }   
)
```

The module will need to Bind the `MyServiceImpl` for the interface `MyService` in its Dingo Module.

Other places that need `MyService` will request the interface `MyService` - so that you can Unit Test this parts and provide a Mock instead of the Default Implementation.

#### Approach 2. (define interface in the consuming package)
Use this in cases where the provider does not provide an interface and you want to mock it.
E.g. for external libs.


### General interface conventions

* Dont blow up the interface with additional concepts - often its better to add a new interface with the extra "concern" or "concept". Smaller interfaces are better maintainable and it also heps reducing breaking changes.
* Optional you can provide pregenerated mocks (e.g. using a tool like mockery).
