# Flamingo Commerce Testing Conventions

## Unit Tests

Go like the unit test are next to the unit they are testing `*_test.go`

Unit Test should be useful, understandable and maintainable.

* essential for domain layer and infrastructure layer
* where useful for application and interface layer

### Test smells
* Mocking the hell: If you see that most of your testcode is mocking dependencies there is something wrong with the test approach or the design
* Table testing complex logic is often not useful - instead create small individual subtests.
 

## Integration Tests

This repository contains a folder `test/integrationtest` with integrationtests. Integration tests boot up a Flamingo application (or parts of it) and let you run blackbox tests.
We differentiate:

* module tests: Where modules are tested standalone: This makes sure that each module:
    * has its dependencies defined well (and don't have too much dependencies)
    * is runable by default (makeing sure the FakeAdapters work)
    * This kind of test are essential useful to **test controller logic** (they are often easier to read and provide more value than mocked controller unit tests)

* project test: Boots up a complete commerce application - making sure that the integration between the modules work.

All this test still do not depend on any external system (because they are supposed to use the FakeAdapters)

## Contract Testing

### Pact Test
Use consumer based contract testing with Pact for Adapters that communicate with external (rest) APIs
